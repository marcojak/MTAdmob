**Version 1.2**
 With this version Loading and Showing Interstitials and rewarded videos are 2 separate events. Now the methods are:
  * void LoadInterstitial(string adUnit);
  * void ShowInterstitial();
  * bool IsInterstitialLoaded();
  * void LoadRewardedVideo(string adUnit);
  * void ShowRewardedVideo();
  * bool IsRewardedVideoLoaded();

  I've removed the two methods:
  * void ShowInterstitial(string adUnit);
  * void ShowRewardedVideo(string adUnit);

  Now you have to load the Interstitial or Rewarded Video and when you want you can show it. You can see if an interstitial or rewared video are loaded using the new methods
  * bool IsInterstitialLoaded();
  * bool IsRewardedVideoLoaded();

  Thanks to these changes you have now more control over the Ads.
